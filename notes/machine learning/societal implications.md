We briefly discussed the importance of AI in today's and tomorrow's society but at that time, we could do so only to a limited extent because we hadn't introduced enough of the technical concepts and methods to ground the discussion on concrete terms.

Now that we have a better understanding of the basic concepts of AI, we are in a much better position to take part in rational discussion about the implications of already the current AI.

## Implication 1: Algorithmic bias

AI, and in particular, machine learning, is being used to make important decisions in many sectors. This brings up the concept of algorithmic bias. What it means is the embedding of a tendency to discriminate according  ethnicity, gender, or other factors when making decision about job applications, bank loans, and so on.

> The main reason for algorithmic bias is human bias in the data. For example, when a job application filtering tool is trained on decisions made by humans, the machine learning algorithm may learn to discriminate against women or individuals with a certain ethic background. Notice that this may happen even if ethnicity or gender are excluded from the data since the algorithm will be able to exploit the information in the applicant's name or address.

Algorithmic bias isn't a hypothetical threat conceived by academic research researchers. It's a real phenomenon that is already affecting people today.

## Online advertising

It has been noticed that online advertisers like Google tend to display ads of lower-pay jobs to women users compared to men. Likewise, doing a search with a name that sounds African American may produce an ad for a tool for accessing criminal records, which is less likely to happen otherwise.

## Social networks

Since social networks are basing their content recommendations essentially on other user's clicks, they can easily lead to magnifying existing biases even if they are very minor to start with. For example, it was observed that when searching for professionals with female first names, LinkedIn would ask the user whether they actually meant a similar male name: searching for Andrea would result in the system asking "did you mean Andrew?" If people occasionally click Andrew's profile, perhaps just out of curiosity, the system will boost Andrew even more in subsequent searches.
